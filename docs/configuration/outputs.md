# Outputs

## Overview

You can use this document to learn about the output types available to manage in a configuration file.

An output tells the Edge Delta agent where to send collected and generated data, such as as metrics, patterns, alerts, etc.

> **Note**
> 
> The terms **output**, **integration**, and **destination** may be used interchangeably. 

There are 3 types of outputs:

  * Stream
  * Trigger
  * Archive

## Step 1: Access Outputs

At a high level, there are 2 ways to manage **Outputs**:

  * If you need to create a new configuration, then you can use the visual editor to populate a YAML file, as well as make changes directly in the YAML file.
  * If you already have an existing configuration, then you can update the configuration in the YAML file. 

***

### Option 1: Access the visual editor for a new configuration

1. In the Edge Delta Admin portal, on the left-side navigation, click **Agent Settings**.
2. Click **Create Configuration**.
3. Click **Visual**.
4. On the right-side, select **Streams**, **Triggers**, or **Archives**. 
5. Select the desired destination, and then complete the missing fields. 

  * To learn more about each destination, see Step 2: 

6. To make additional configurations to the configuration file, click the back button, and then select a new configuration parameter to manage. 
7. To save the configuraiton and exit the visual editor, click **Save**. 
8. Refresh the screen to view the newly created configuration in the table. 

***

### Option 2: Access the YAML file for an existing configuration

1. In the Edge Delta Admin portal, on the left-side navigation, click **Agent Settings**.

## Review Collected Data Types

When you create an output, you have the option to configure which data types the Edge Delta agent should collect / generate and send to a streaming destination. 

| Feature Type | Description | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| metric | This feaure type sends metrics that are generated by processors in the workflow. By default, this feature type is enabled. | 
| edac | This feature type sends contextual logs that happened around an anomaly. edac represents Edge Delta Anomaly Context. By default, this feature type is enabled.  | 
| cluster | This feature type sends cluster patterns and samples. Patterns are sent in the following format: "{cluster-pattern}, {count}" By default, this feature type is enabled.  | 
| logs | This feaure type forwards raw logs to a stream destination. | 
| topk | This feaure type send top-k records that are generated by the top-k processor. | 
| all | This feaure type enables the **metric**, **edac**, and **cluster** features for streaming destinations. |

## Review Streaming Destinations

Edge Delta supports the following streaming destinations: 

### Splunk

The Splunk output will stream analytics and insights to a Splunk HEC endpoint. 

In the Edge Delta Admin portal, in the visual editor, when you select **Splunk** as the output type, the following fields will appear:

| Parameter | Description | Required or Optional |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| name | Enter a descriptive name for the output, which will be used to map this destination to a workflow. | Required |
| integration\_name | This parameter refers to the organization-level integration created in the **Integrations** page. If you enter this name, then the rest of the fields will be automatically populated. If you need to add multiple instances of the same integration into the config, then you can add a custom name to each instance via the **name** field. In this situation, the name should be used to refer to the specific instance of the destination in the workflows.  | Optional |
| type | Select **splunk**. | Required |
| endpoint | Enter the full Splunk HEC URI for this integration. | Required |
| token | Enter the Splunk HEC token for this integration. | Required |

The following example displays an output without the name of the organization-level integration:

```yaml
      - name: splunk-integration
        type: splunk
        endpoint: "<protocol>://<host>:<port>/<endpoint>"
        token: "32-character GUID token"
        index: "main"
```

The following example displays if enter the name of the organization-level integration:

```yaml
      - integration_name: my-org-splunk
```

The following example displays if there are multiple instances of the same desitnation that need to route different data types to different Splunk indexes: 

```yaml
- name: edac-splunk-dest
  integration_name: orgs-splunk
  features: edac
  index: edac-index
- integration_name: orgs-splunk
  name: metric-splunk-dest
  features: metric
  index: metric-index
```

#### Setting up the Splunk Integration

The process is different between Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise, so it is essential to follow the appropriate instructions for your environment

There are 3 important elements to your configuration:

* Configure an HEC Token in Splunk
* Determine the Correct HEC Endpoint in Splunk
* Import the Edge Delta dashboard into Splunk

#### Determining your HEC Endpoint

Before continuing, please ensure you have gathered the following information:

* Splunk deployment type (Enterprise, Cloud, Free Trial, etc)
* Splunk hostname (from Splunk Browser URI) 
* Input  Protocol (HTTPS is default)

##### Splunk Cloud (Cloud, Free Trial, Cloud on GCP) Format

Replace <splunk_hostname> with your organization’s hostname

* Splunk Cloud
  * URI Format: https://http-inputs-<splunk_hostname>:443/services/collector/event
* Splunk Free Trial 
  * URI Format: https://inputs.<splunk_hostname>:8088/services/collector/event
* Splunk Cloud on GCP
  * URI Format: https://http-inputs.<splunk_hostname>:443/services/collector/event

##### Splunk Enterprise

* URI Format: https://<splunk_hostname>:8088/services/collector/event
