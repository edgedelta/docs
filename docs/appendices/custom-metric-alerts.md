# Custom Metric Alerts

## Overview

One of the core functionality of Edge Delta agent is to be able to extract valuable information close to the source and detect anomalous cases. [Processors](../configuration/processors.md) documentation explains how to configure various processors in agent config. Some of the processors generate metrics such as _error.count_, _latency.avg_. These metrics are reported to Edge Delta backend as well as configured streaming destination. Edge Delta's metric storage powers following functionality

* Most of the charts on [admin.edgedelta.com](https://admin.edgedelta.com/)
* Filters on [admin.edgedelta.com](https://admin.edgedelta.com/)
* Custom Metric Alerts

Rest of this page focuses on Custom Metric Alerts

## Custom Metric Alerts

[Metric Exporer](https://admin.edgedelta.com/metrics) page is useful to check the outputs of the processors. From the top-right filters a time range and Tag must be selected at minimum. More granular source filtering is also available such as kubernetes namespace, container name etc. Second step is to pick a metric from the Metric dropdown. Note that the dropdown shows list of metric name prefixes. All associated metrics will be shown in the chart below. Optionally an aggregation function, aggregation window and group by can be selected from the dropdowns available at the top of the page.

The page consists of 2 charts. First one shows various metrics generated by the agent based on processing rule configuration and the second one shows the anomaly score of the metric at a point in time.

You will notice a **+ CREATE ALERT** button at the top of the page. Clicking on it will open a dialog which is pre-populated based on the current filter selections. The only thing you need to decide is the threshold for this alert. By default _Anomaly Score &gt; 90_ is selected. A static threshold can also be specified if you know what your expected value is for given aggregation function and window. Currently slack and email based notification is supported. Email addresses can be entered on the form. Slack destinations must be configured at [Integrations](https://admin.edgedelta.com/integrations) page.

For example, below screenshot shows an alert configuration which fires if sum of api\_access.count metric over 5 minutes period exceeds 10k. This threshold is evaluated every 5 minute in Edge Delta backend which aggregates the metrics reported by agents belonging to filtered Tag.

_Note:_ Tag is specified at [agent\_settings](../configuration/agent-settings.md) section of the config

### Agent based alerts \(aka signals\) vs backend generated alerts \(aka findings\)

You might have noticed that the [processors](../configuration/processors.md) also have some threshold configuration. Those are evaluated by individual agents running on your nodes. It's possible to get notified directly by the agents in real time as soon as something anomalous happens. These agent based alerts are called _Signal_ and can be seen on [Insights](https://admin.edgedelta.com/insights) page.

In addition to the agent based Signals, Edge Delta provides Custom Metric Alerts functionality which can be used to get alerted on aggregate data over a longer period of time. These are generated by Edge Delta backend system and called _Finding_. There are other types of _Findings_ that are automatically generated by Edge Delta such as Pattern Skyline Findings, Correlated Alert Findings etc.
